		<div id="123">The King sat naked. Like a foolish pauper on the
			street, he sat leaning against a cold wall, drawing in his blue,
			goose-bumped legs. He shivered, with his eyes closed, he listened,
			but everything was quiet.</div>
		<div>He awoke at midnight from a nightmare and immediatelly
			understood that he was finished. Some one weezed and writhed by the
			door of the bedroom suite, he heard footsteps, metalic jingling and
			drunken mummbling of His Highness, Uncle Buht: "Let me through... Let
			me.. Break it down, hell with it..." Wet with icy sweat, he slintly
			rolled off his bed, ducked into a secter closet, and loosing himself
			he ran down the underground passage. Something sqelched under his
			bare feet, the startled rats dashed away, but he did not notice
			anything, just now, sitting next to a wall he remembered everything;
			the darkness, the slippery walls, and the pain from a blow on the
			head against the shakled door to the temple, and his own unberable
			high yelp.</div>
